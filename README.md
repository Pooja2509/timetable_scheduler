# timetable_scheduler
Automated Timetable Scheduler - Final year College project using ReactJS . 
The aim is to design and build a software which is capable of generating a timetable of different classes, when the list of teachers, list of classrooms, list of subjects and various other constraints are given as input. This can be used by anyone with minimal computer knowledge and can be used for payroll management . As Preparing timetable of a department is a really tedious task and becomes more cumbersome and difficult when the scale of the scheduling is enlarged.
